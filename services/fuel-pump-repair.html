    <h2>Professional Fuel Pump Replacement — At Your Location</h2>
    <p>Your vehicle's fuel pump is the heart of its fuel delivery system. Located inside the fuel tank on most modern vehicles, it pressurizes gasoline and delivers it to the engine's fuel injectors at precise volumes and pressures. When it fails, your engine starves for fuel — and you're going nowhere.</p>
    <p>At Auto Repair Mobile Mechanic, our ASE-certified technicians perform complete fuel pump diagnosis and replacement at your home, office, or roadside location throughout <strong>Fort Lauderdale</strong>, <strong>Tampa</strong>, and all surrounding South Florida communities. We arrive with the specialized tools, diagnostic equipment, and quality replacement parts needed to get your fuel system working properly again.</p>

    <h2>Fuel System Services We Perform On-Site</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fuel pump testing and diagnosis</strong> — pressure testing, voltage checks, and flow rate analysis</li>
      <li><strong>Electric fuel pump replacement</strong> — in-tank and external pump replacement for all makes</li>
      <li><strong>Fuel filter replacement</strong> — inline and in-tank filters to ensure clean fuel delivery</li>
      <li><strong>Fuel pressure regulator service</strong> — testing and replacement when pressure is inconsistent</li>
      <li><strong>Fuel line inspection and repair</strong> — checking for leaks, cracks, and corrosion</li>
      <li><strong>Fuel sending unit repair</strong> — fixing inaccurate fuel gauge readings</li>
      <li><strong>Fuel injector cleaning</strong> — restoring proper spray patterns and fuel atomization</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Warning Signs Your Fuel Pump Is Failing</h2>
    <p>A failing fuel pump rarely dies all at once. Watch for these progressive symptoms that indicate trouble:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Engine sputtering at high speeds</strong> — the pump can't maintain adequate pressure under load</li>
      <li><strong>Vehicle surging</strong> — intermittent fuel delivery causes jerky acceleration</li>
      <li><strong>Loss of power under stress</strong> — climbing hills, towing, or accelerating hard reveals weak pump output</li>
      <li><strong>Engine won't start</strong> — no fuel pressure means no combustion (the pump has fully failed)</li>
      <li><strong>Whining noise from the fuel tank</strong> — a worn pump motor produces a high-pitched whine</li>
      <li><strong>Decreased fuel efficiency</strong> — a failing pump can cause the engine to run rich or lean</li>
      <li><strong>Engine stalling at operating temperature</strong> — heat exacerbates weak pump motors</li>
      <li><strong>Check engine light</strong> — fuel system trouble codes like P0230, P0231, or P0087</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Mobile Fuel Pump Replacement Works</h2>
    <p>Fuel pump replacement is a significant repair that many people assume requires a shop. Here's how we handle it on-site:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Diagnosis First:</strong> We begin with fuel pressure testing using professional gauges, electrical testing of the pump circuit, and scan tool diagnosis of fuel system codes. We confirm the pump is actually the problem before recommending replacement — unlike shops that guess and charge you anyway.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Transparent Quote:</strong> We explain exactly what we found, show you the test results, and provide an itemized quote before any work begins. No surprises, no pressure tactics.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Professional Replacement:</strong> We safely depressurize the fuel system, remove the fuel tank (when required for in-tank pumps), replace the pump assembly with an OEM-spec unit, install a new fuel filter and strainer, and reassemble everything to factory specifications.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Verification:</strong> After installation, we test fuel pressure, check for leaks, verify proper engine operation, clear any codes, and take a test drive to confirm everything is working perfectly.</p>

    <h2>Why Mobile Fuel Pump Repair Beats the Shop</h2>
    <p>A vehicle with a dead fuel pump doesn't drive. That means a tow truck to a shop, which can cost $100–$250 in South Florida. With mobile fuel pump repair:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No tow truck expense</strong> — we come directly to your stalled vehicle</li>
      <li><strong>No shop markup</strong> — our lower overhead means lower prices for you</li>
      <li><strong>Faster turnaround</strong> — no waiting behind other vehicles in a shop queue</li>
      <li><strong>Watch the work</strong> — full transparency, you see exactly what's being done</li>
      <li><strong>Convenient scheduling</strong> — we work around your schedule, not the other way around</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Florida Heat and Your Fuel Pump</h2>
    <p>South Florida's extreme heat accelerates fuel pump wear. Temperatures inside a parked car's fuel tank can exceed 140°F on a summer day. This heat breaks down the pump motor's brushes faster, degrades rubber seals and diaphragms, and causes fuel to vaporize — making the pump work harder. We typically see fuel pumps fail 15–20% sooner in Florida compared to northern states. That's why we recommend being alert to early symptoms rather than waiting for a complete failure that leaves you stranded on I-95 or the Howard Frankland Bridge in Tampa.</p>

    <h2>Fuel Pump Replacement Pricing</h2>
    <p>Fuel pump costs vary significantly by vehicle make, model, and year. Here's a general guide:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fuel pump diagnosis:</strong> $80–$120 (applied toward repair if you proceed)</li>
      <li><strong>Fuel pump replacement (most vehicles):</strong> $400–$900 (parts + labor)</li>
      <li><strong>Fuel filter replacement:</strong> $60–$150</li>
      <li><strong>Fuel pressure regulator:</strong> $150–$350</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We provide exact pricing for your specific vehicle before starting work. All fuel pump replacements include our <strong>12-month / 12,000-mile warranty</strong> on parts and labor.</p>
